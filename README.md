# **Healthy Pomodoro App**

Development of a pomodoro timer app inspired by the [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) short course Next Level Week #4 (NLW#4) about ReactJS.

This app has a pomodoro timer where the user wins experience points by finishing cycles or chalenges. Between pomodoro cycles, on the breaks, the user is presented with a simple task of walkin, stretching, exercising. This helps users who works for many hours seated in front of the computer screen.

Feel free to play around with the code or simply access the app for a demo.

## Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions. Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts.
